# Autonomous-Parking-Using-Deep-RL
Revolutionizing autonomous parking in urban environments using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This project investigates Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithms, employing Unityâ€™s ML-Agents toolkit to train cars in virtual simulations, bridging the gap between theory and real-world applications for efficient and safe autonomous parking.
